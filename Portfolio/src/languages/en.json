Always on the lookout for new projects, I enjoy creating sophisticated web applications,small to medium in scale,with dynamic interactions and features.\n \n My skill set is diverse: I'm comfortable with design, analysis, and logic development, although my main interest lies in the back-end. I enjoy building efficient, polished solutions for challenging projects.\n\nBeyond development, I’m curious and enjoy exploring a bit of everything. I love reading, especially on topics like psychology, personal development, science, and history. As a regular runner and swimmer, I stay active with a range of fitness activities. I’m also a film enthusiast, always on the hunt for new movies , and I’m a fan of board games, especially those that combine teamwork with a bit of friendly rivalry! (check out my TVTime profile " ,

It is a number placement game that combines chance and strategy. The player receives a board and draws 4 numbered tiles, which they place on the diagonal cells. On their turn, the player either draws a hidden tile or takes a visible tile and places it on their board. The numbers must always be arranged in ascending order from right to left and top to bottom. If a player cannot place a tile, they discard it face-up on the table. The value of the numbers must be carefully considered, and players need to strategically choose their placements.",
