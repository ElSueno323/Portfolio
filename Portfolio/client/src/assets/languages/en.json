Always on the lookout for new projects, I enjoy creating sophisticated web applications,small to medium in scale,with dynamic interactions and features.\n \n My skill set is diverse: I'm comfortable with design, analysis, and logic development, although my main interest lies in the back-end. I enjoy building efficient, polished solutions for challenging projects.\n\nBeyond development, I’m curious and enjoy exploring a bit of everything. I love reading, especially on topics like psychology, personal development, science, and history. As a regular runner and swimmer, I stay active with a range of fitness activities. I’m also a film enthusiast, always on the hunt for new movies , and I’m a fan of board games, especially those that combine teamwork with a bit of friendly rivalry! (check out my TVTime profile " ,
